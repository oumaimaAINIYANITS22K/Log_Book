## **Reflections**

### **Username Enumeration via Different Responses**
This lab highlighted how inconsistent login error messages can be exploited to identify valid usernames. The challenge was recognizing subtle differences in response behavior and automating the process efficiently.

### **2FA Simple Bypass**
I learned that weak implementations of two-factor authentication, such as predictable codes or bypassing via session hijacking, can lead to security breaches. The most challenging part was identifying a practical bypass method and testing it effectively.

### **Password Reset Broken Logic**
This lab demonstrated how insecure password reset flows can be exploited. Understanding how to manipulate reset tokens or email verification steps was insightful. The hardest part was constructing a valid exploit chain.

### **Unprotected Admin Functionality**
This exercise showed how missing authentication layers on admin panels can expose sensitive functionalities. The key takeaway was the importance of proper access controls.

### **Unprotected Admin Functionality with Unpredictable URL**
Even if an admin panel isn't directly linked, attackers can discover it through various techniques. The main challenge was locating the hidden admin panel and bypassing access restrictions.

### **User Role Controlled by Request Parameter**
Here, I exploited the ability to change user roles through insecure request parameters. It emphasized the importance of server-side validation to prevent privilege escalation.

### **SQL Injection - Hidden Data Retrieval**
I learned how SQL injection can be used to extract hidden database content. Crafting the right queries without triggering security defenses was the tricky part.

### **SQL Injection - Login Bypass**
By injecting SQL payloads into login forms, I managed to authenticate without valid credentials. This lab reinforced the importance of prepared statements to prevent such attacks.

## **New Reflection: Penetration Testing on Booking System (19-20.2.2025)**
I spent **two days (20 hours total)** conducting a **full penetration test** on the **Booking Systemâ€™s registration page**.  
### **Day 1 (19.2.2025): Setting Up the Environment**
- Installed **VirtualBox & Kali Linux**.
- Installed **Docker, OWASP ZAP, and Burp Suite** for penetration testing.
- Cloned the **Booking System repository** and deployed the app with **Docker Compose**.
- Confirmed that the system was **running on localhost**.

### **Day 2 (20.2.2025): Penetration Testing & Reporting**
- **Tested the registration system** for vulnerabilities.
- **Key Findings:**
  - **Plaintext Password Storage** ðŸ›‘ (**Critical**)  
    - The database stored passwords in **plaintext** instead of using **bcrypt hashing**.
    - **Fix:** Implement bcrypt hashing before storing credentials.
  
  - **SQL Injection Vulnerability** âš  (**Medium**)  
    - The registration form allowed SQL injection via input fields.
    - **Fix:** Use **prepared statements** and input validation.
  
  - **Insecure User Role Assignment** âš  (**Medium**)  
    - Users could escalate privileges by modifying request parameters.
    - **Fix:** Enforce **server-side role validation**.

- **Created a penetration testing report** (`report.md`).
- **Pushed the findings to GitHub** and submitted the report.
- **Posted vulnerability findings** in the discussion forum.

## **Conclusion**
Completing these labs and penetration tests was an insightful experience that reinforced my understanding of web security vulnerabilities. I spent time getting familiar with security tools, setting up test environments, and refining my testing methodologies. The hands-on approach helped me build confidence in identifying and mitigating security risks.  

Going forward, I plan to explore **more advanced vulnerabilities** and improve my **exploitation techniques**. This logbook will be updated regularly to track future progress and learning. ðŸš€
