## New Reflection: MD5 Hash Cracking & Password Recovery (16.3.2025)

Spent **6 hours** working on **password cracking techniques** using **Hashcat and online lookup services**.

### Approach & Findings
1. **Dictionary Attack**  
   - Used **Hashcat** with **RockYou.txt**.  
   - Cracked several common passwords but some remained unknown.

2. **Online Hash Lookup Services**  
   - Tested sites like **Reverse Hash Lookup**, **Hashes.org**, **MD5Online**, and **LeakedPassword**.  
   - Retrieved a few additional passwords from these databases.

3. **Brute-Force Testing**  
   - Attempted **custom brute-force attack** with varying lengths.  
   - **Final estimation: 30+ years** required to crack remaining hashes.  
   - **Conclusion:** Impractical to continue brute-force attempts.

### Outcome
‚úÖ 7 out of 10 passwords cracked.  
‚úÖ Online hash lookup services were the fastest method.  
‚ùå Brute-force cracking was infeasible due to extreme time estimates.

## Reflections

### Username Enumeration via Different Responses
This lab highlighted how inconsistent login error messages can be exploited to identify valid usernames. The challenge was recognizing subtle differences in response behavior and automating the process efficiently.

### 2FA Simple Bypass
I learned that weak implementations of two-factor authentication, such as predictable codes or bypassing via session hijacking, can lead to security breaches. The most challenging part was identifying a practical bypass method and testing it effectively.

### Password Reset Broken Logic
This lab demonstrated how insecure password reset flows can be exploited. Understanding how to manipulate reset tokens or email verification steps was insightful. The hardest part was constructing a valid exploit chain.

### Unprotected Admin Functionality
This exercise showed how missing authentication layers on admin panels can expose sensitive functionalities. The key takeaway was the importance of proper access controls.

### Unprotected Admin Functionality with Unpredictable URL
Even if an admin panel isn't directly linked, attackers can discover it through various techniques. The main challenge was locating the hidden admin panel and bypassing access restrictions.

### User Role Controlled by Request Parameter
Here, I exploited the ability to change user roles through insecure request parameters. It emphasized the importance of server-side validation to prevent privilege escalation.

### SQL Injection - Hidden Data Retrieval
I learned how SQL injection can be used to extract hidden database content. Crafting the right queries without triggering security defenses was the tricky part.

### SQL Injection - Login Bypass
By injecting SQL payloads into login forms, I managed to authenticate without valid credentials. This lab reinforced the importance of prepared statements to prevent such attacks.

## New Reflection: Penetration Testing on Booking System (19-20.2.2025 & 5.3.2025)

I spent **two days (20 hours total) on Phase 1** and **an additional 7 hours on Phase 2**, conducting a full penetration test on the Booking System‚Äôs registration page.

### Phase 1: Initial Penetration Testing (19-20.2.2025)

**Day 1 (19.2.2025): Setting Up the Environment**
- Installed **VirtualBox & Kali Linux**.
- Installed **Docker, OWASP ZAP, and Burp Suite** for penetration testing.
- Cloned the **Booking System repository** and deployed the app with **Docker Compose**.
- Confirmed that the system was **running on localhost**.

**Day 2 (20.2.2025): Penetration Testing & Reporting**
- Tested the registration system for vulnerabilities.

**Key Findings:**
- üõë **Plaintext Password Storage** (Critical)
- ‚ö† **SQL Injection Vulnerability** (Medium)
- ‚ö† **Insecure User Role Assignment** (Medium)

- Created a penetration testing report (`report.md`).
- Pushed the findings to GitHub and submitted the report.
- Posted vulnerability findings in the discussion forum.

---

### Phase 2: Updated Penetration Testing (5.3.2025)
- Conducted an updated scan using **ZAP by Checkmarx**.
- Investigated **API response inconsistencies** with different User-Agent headers.

**Key Finding:**
- ‚ö† **User-Agent Fuzzer Alert** (Medium)

- Updated the penetration testing report with new findings.

## New Reflection: Finalization of Booking System Project (26.4.2025)

Today, I finalized all missing parts of the Booking System Project for submission.

### Tasks Completed:
- Performed and documented dictionary and non-dictionary password attacks using Hydra.
- Simulated Burp Suite attacks (dictionary and non-dictionary scenarios).
- Generated a ZAP vulnerability report.
- Wrote and finalized the Phase 1 and Phase 2 project reflections and full final report.

### Outcome:
‚úÖ Practical hands-on experience with Hydra, Burp Suite, and ZAP.  
‚úÖ Completed documentation and reflections ready for final assignment submission.  
‚úÖ Reinforced real-world pentesting methodologies, attack simulations, and professional reporting skills.

# Conclusion

Completing these labs and penetration tests was an insightful experience that reinforced my understanding of web security vulnerabilities.  
I spent time getting familiar with security tools, setting up test environments, and refining my testing methodologies.  
The hands-on approach helped me build confidence in identifying and mitigating security risks.
